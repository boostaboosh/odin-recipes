# odin-recipes

A basic recipe website to display the HTML I've learnt by putting it into practice.

A website with a homepage that links to webpages containing recipes.
Creation of this website required the use of git version control basics, well written commit messages, the VS code text editor, command line basics, HTML 5 basics: boilerplate, text, lists, images, and links.
