        <h2 class="steps">Steps</h2>
        <ol class="steps">
            <li>Put your <strong>non-stick</strong> cooking pan <em>with a lid</em> on a <strong>low heat</strong>.</li>
            <li>Scramble the eggs in a bowl until smooth and no homogeneous parts of yolk or albumen remain.</li>
            <li>Chop up and prepare your omelette fillings.</li>
            <li>Add your egg mixture to the pan.</li>
            <li>Immediately start dragging the the external parts of the omelette towards the centre of the pan using a spatula. Once you've done so, reform the omelette's shape by tilting the pan to refill the displaced egg with new liquid egg mixture.</li>
            <li>Once the previous step becomes hard to do because there isn't enough liquid egg mixture to refill the gaps easily it's time to add your filling to the omelette.</li>
            <li>Fill half of your omelette up with your fillings.</li>
            <li>Help yourself with a spatula to close your omelette in the shape of a half moon. The omelette should contain the fillings in a similar fashion to a calzone or cornish pasty.</li>
            <li>Once you've close your omelette place a lid on the pan to seal it shut and then remove the omelette from the heat by taking it out of the pan.</li>
            <li>The last step should be executed quickly as we don't want to over-cook the eggs. This is achieved by performing all steps quickly and making sure to keep the cooker heat <strong>low</strong>.</li>
            <li>Use salt flakes and other preferred seasonings to season your omelette to perfection.</li>
        </ol>
